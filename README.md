# roommates-app
Capstone project for Southern Utah University.

The app was meant to be a semester long project that would be worked on a little bit every day.
This app is meant to be a proof of concept for a social/informational application for roommates living in a dorm-like setting.
The app features both front end and back end. The front end is made using react native. The backend is made using expressJS and
uses a PostgreSQL database to store user information. Users are able to view events, see announcements, discover alternative
living situations, create and complete tasks, and a partially working chat function.
